# include

Packing all needed images, scripts, stylesheets in a html file and save it to a directory.

If you are trying to copy all the files that a html needs to a new directory.  You can use `include` to help you deal with this problem. `include` is a package, which can pack **ONLY** the scripts and styles a specific html, here is a following example.

`index.html`:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style/style.css">
  </head>

  <body>

    <script type="text/javascript" src="./script/script.js">
    </script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/Base64/0.3.0/base64.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="./script/script2.js">
    </script>

  </body>

</html>
```

`script/script.js`:

```js
(function() {
  console.log('this is a test script');
})();
```

`script/script2.js`:

```js
(function() {
  console.log('this is a test script2');
})();
```

----

Entering `include index.html -o files`, `include` will create a new directory that save all `index.html` needs. Like `script/script.js`, and `script/script2.js`. As a result, the final folder `files` will bild a file structure like the following source tree.

```
files ------- index.html
        |---- script ------ script.js
                      |---- script2.js
```


## Prerequisite

- PhantomJS (http://phantomjs.org/build.html)

### Why

The reason building this repository is that if I want to wrapped a html file you need. You can hardly know what the exactly files the html needed, might be some `.js`, `.css` files or images, fonts. In the past, you would probably copied the whole images, scripts, stylesheets folder. 

`include` help you find out what is needed in the specific html file, and make a copy to a output folder.   This could help you a lot if you are trying to deploy a specific html file.

### How it work

The repository create a local server at port `4444` (so you shouldn't use the port), and use `phantomjs` to request the local server and find out what files the html need.


## Install

```
npm install include-html
```

## Usage

```js
var include = require('../');

include(__dirname + '/html/index.html', __dirname + '/output')
```

This will copied all the files (images, scripts, styles) that `./html/index.html` file needs and copied to `./output`


## API

###Include('a html file', 'output directory')

- html file: a html file. (absolute route)
- output directory: don't worry if the directory is not exist, `include` will automatically make the folder for you. (absolute route)

## CLI usage

```
Usage: include [options] <source to your html, default ./index.html>

  Options:

    -h, --help                output usage information
    -V, --version             output the version number
    -o, --output <directory>  Path to output directory, defaults to current directory
    -p, --port <port number>  Port which your local server start.
```

#### CLI example

```
include ./test/index.html -o output-test-folder
```

`include` will magically packed your `js`, `css`, `image` files, to the output folder that you entered.
